Thankfully, he's stopped using them.

**Bee Summary:**
## Summary: 

Today was a busy day filled with little moments. I had a funny interaction with someone who was wearing a pro-LGBTQ+ shirt.  Given we are in North Carolina, I told her how brave she was for wearing it, assuming she was local. Turns out, she was from California! We had a nice chat about how her home state is much more liberal.  She even told me, "You should see my car," which made me laugh.  I also had to help Ivette find a form for Russell - it was on her desk. It was a  "YWCA Employee Handbook" acknowledgment form for Russell to sign.  Later on, I took a moment to appreciate the nice weather in Wilmington - sunny with a high of 64° -  with my dogs, Grape and Peach.  They are such good dogs! I'm a little worried about my health, though. I need to remember to talk to my doctor on Monday about my lab results, my high blood glucose levels even with the Farxiga, and the fact that my elbow injection didn't help.

**Bee Summary:**
## Summary
Today was a mixed bag. I had a frustrating moment with my dog, Peach, who wouldn't stop bugging me to go out even though I had just taken her. I think she might be drinking too much water because her poop looked a little hard.  On a positive note, my boss was really nice and changed my schedule for tomorrow so I could go in at my usual time. 

## Atmosphere
Overall, the atmosphere was a bit chaotic and stressful. There were multiple conversations happening at once, and I was juggling a lot of different tasks. 

## Key Takeaways
* **Investment Strategy:** I need to research investment options that perform well when the stock market declines, such as bonds and treasury bills. I should contact Fidelity for advice.
* **Peso Exchange Rate:** The current value of the dollar against the peso is high, which could present an opportunity.
* **Peach's Bathroom Habits:** I need to keep an eye on Peach's water intake and potentially consult with a vet if her bathroom issues persist. 
* **Work Schedule:** My boss was very accommodating and adjusted my schedule for tomorrow.
