**Bee Summary:**
## Summary: 

Today was a busy day filled with little moments. I had a funny interaction with someone who was wearing a pro-LGBTQ+ shirt.  Given we are in North Carolina, I told her how brave she was for wearing it, assuming she was local. Turns out, she was from California! We had a nice chat about how her home state is much more liberal.  She even told me, "You should see my car," which made me laugh.  I also had to help Ivette find a form for Russell - it was on her desk. It was a  "YWCA Employee Handbook" acknowledgment form for Russell to sign.  Later on, I took a moment to appreciate the nice weather in Wilmington - sunny with a high of 64° -  with my dogs, Grape and Peach.  They are such good dogs! I'm a little worried about my health, though. I need to remember to talk to my doctor on Monday about my lab results, my high blood glucose levels even with the Farxiga, and the fact that my elbow injection didn't help.

# Discussing double bagging groceries and how to assemble a floating frame
## Discussing double bagging groceries.
> You: Stop it.
> You: Just out of curiosity, you double bagged that.
> Ivette: Yeah, right.
> You: Oh, I didn't even notice.
> You: Thank you.
> Ivette: That's why, yeah, it didn't come.
> Ivette: Like certain bags, like she got the nuts and stuff, it just I saw there was a rip in it.
> You: Yep.
> You: I thought it was something more specific.
## Ivette demonstrates how to assemble a floating frame
> You: All right, so did you get much further up?
> Ivette: I guess the other one.
> Ivette: I was going to show you.
> Ivette: It's it's not that hard to fly.
> Ivette: It's like there's I'll let you do the last one, but I knew there's another one, so I was like, I'll just it up.
> Ivette: Um, so on this up here.
> Ivette: Okay.
> Ivette: Put it to the side.
> Ivette: Not this part.
> Ivette: You do.
> Ivette: Take this out.
> Ivette: Throw this away for me?
> You: Oh, these are the backing, right?
> You: If they wanted to back.
> Ivette: Yeah.
> Ivette: So.
> Ivette: I can throw that in the trash.
> Ivette: That's fine.
> Ivette: I just like wipe down here with the glass to make sure nothing's on there, especially if there was a bag, this is like really important.
> Ivette: But since there isn't a bag, they can wipe it down if they need, you know, like if it gets dustier or dirty.
> You: Right.
> Ivette: But when there's a bag there, if there's something trapped in it, it's trapped.
> Ivette: So, then you get um oh, taking the back off there.
> Ivette: Second one's usually always easier, but put your glove back on, you don't want to touch it.
> Ivette: I don't know why I did the other one back.
> Ivette: Okay, I like doing it here because usually they grab everything, right?
> Ivette: So then you just take the plastic part.
> Ivette: Should look like this.
> You: Got it, floating frame.
> Ivette: This is the side that matters about being clean too, because this is the side that goes uh against the glass.
> You: Right.
> Ivette: So, I'm just trying to get this on the side here.
> Ivette: Sorry.
> You: I hope it's not busy tonight.
> You: I still have a whole bunch of uh mylars to put up.
> Ivette: That is fine.
> Ivette: I'm not I'm not worried about that.
> Ivette: We can hang out.
> Ivette: So, once this down, like I said, so then you're going to so for like with this, you can't close all four.
> Ivette: Um but still like even it doesn't fit, but you have to do it this way.
> Ivette: So, welcome in.
> Ivette: So, take this side and um just pop it in like this way, make sure it's not too far on this side, just make sure it's like in the middle.
> Ivette: Pops right in.
> Ivette: Then this side.
> You: Okay, I never want to do this.
> Ivette: It's really not hard.
> You: I know, I'm just joking.
> Ivette: I know.
> Ivette: Yeah, it seems more like but it's really especially if it was busy, I don't know, I get nervous.
> Ivette: Yeah, during Christmas time it's annoying, but it's fine.
> Ivette: When you do this side.
> Ivette: And you notice how they move, but as long as it's in place, it's fine.
> Ivette: The last step.
> Ivette: Corner.
> Ivette: Yep.
> Ivette: And this one has a extra thing of corners.
> Ivette: Unlike the canvases.
> Ivette: You put these in first.
> Ivette: So, yeah, I know.

> Ivette: Like here, put it up.
> Ivette: Gently.
> Ivette: Put long ways on it.
> You: Yeah.
> You: I I'll just put it up here.
> Ivette: So, this piece, these go in the corner.
> Ivette: Just kidding.
> Ivette: Go this way, sorry, that was my fault.
> Ivette: And they should snap right in the corner.
> You: Oh, I see the difference between the two.
> You: And then you know the side because it just goes so like these goes against the corner.
> Ivette: Fits right in.
> Ivette: And then these are just like the other ones.

> Ariel: There's two ribbons left and like six.
> Ariel: Does change the ribbon?
> Ariel: Yeah, look.
> Ariel: But we everybody knows we change the ribbon.
> Ariel: So then you can leave that until you.
> You: Yeah.
> You: Oh.
> Ariel: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, there's two left.
> Ariel: Just because it says ribbon, it doesn't mean you can't.
> Ariel: It's just kind of ribbon.
> Ariel: I can understand that if you're in here and you're.
> Ariel: Bruce even knows that.
> You: I do know that.
> You: You told me just once and I.
> Ariel: Yeah.
> Ariel: You know, you see the a million papers everywhere that say change change at the same time.

> Ariel: Yeah, just.
## Ivette teaches Bruce how to apply the protective film to the floating frames, offering tips and assistance.

> Ariel: That easy.
> Ariel: Just do it slow.
> You: Oh, look at it.
> You: Oh, is that the wrong side?
> Ariel: No, it's fine.
> You: I was just wondering how easy it was.
> Ariel: And then grab it with the hand that doesn't have the like grab the blue stuff with your hand and then hold that down with the glove.
> Ariel: Yeah, and then pull it off.
> Ariel: Cuz some of it is easy, sometimes it's not.
> Ariel: I know it's tape, which I'll I find if you go from the sides.
> You: Yeah.

# Ivette calls me while driving home and we discuss my new job at Walgreens, my previous job at Lowe's, and my recent cold
## Catching up and discussing dinner
> Ivette: Call Eve Meyer.
> Unknown Speaker 3: Which phone for Eve Meyer?
> Unknown Speaker 3: Home?
> Unknown Speaker 3: Calling Eve Meyer.
> Unknown Speaker 3: Mobile.
> You: Hi, you've reached Eve Meyer.
> Ivette: Hello.
> You: Hi.
> You: I was almost worried.
> You: I was almost thinking, oh no, I have energy and I'm driving home.
> Ivette: Yeah, you just like go.
> Ivette: We just finished up dinner, so we're sitting here.
> You: How are the.
> Ivette: Myron's putting away the group, the um, the dinner food before because it's all still sitting out.
> Ivette: So, how's it going?
## My recent cold
> You: Um, yeah, it's going just fine, I guess.
> You: Um, we're all getting over like the third cold we've had.
> You: And and.
> Ivette: Oh no.
> You: Yeah, it's just been pretty awful.
> You: And uh.
> Ivette: Yeah, you're probably exposed a whole bunch of new things with kids being in school and maybe being at a different place.
> You: Yeah.
> You: It could be, but I I know it's yeah, that's for sure.
> You: And the funny thing is is also it's also pollen season.
> You: I mean it just started.
> Ivette: Oh.
> You: So I look I look really forward to finishing this damn cold and then having allergies.
> Ivette: Yeah, yeah.
> Ivette: It's always going to be something.
## How long I've been at Walgreens
> You: Oh my god.
> You: Um.
> You: So it's good.
> Ivette: Yeah, go ahead.
> Ivette: Yeah, go ahead.
> Ivette: Uh, I was just going to ask you how long you've been at Walgreens now.
> You: Uh, maybe been about a month and a half.
> Ivette: Okay, so it's not that long.
> You: Let's see.
> You: It's it's March.
> You: So no, more like um two two and a half months.
> You: Yeah, I left Lowe's at in January.
> Ivette: Yeah, I remember when we talked there were issues, but I couldn't quite remember if you had quit or you were you were still there, but things weren't going well.
> You: Yeah.
> You: Yeah, you know, I so it's partly mental illness.
## My mental health struggles at Lowe's
> Ivette: Um.
> You: Yeah.
> You: I uh and it makes no sense if you don't understand mental illness.
> You: Um but um so I would make some small mistakes.
> You: And um things like, oh, I forgot to put, you know, the top of the paint can on uh securely.
> You: And oh, the customer spilled it in their car.
> You: So, you know, obviously that that's a big deal.
> You: And the thing was for me, what happened was I sort of did get anxious about that kind of thing.
> Ivette: Yeah.
> You: And of course, that made it worse.
> Ivette: Yeah.
> You: So it was sort of just the spiral of, you know, oh, if I made the next mistake, you know, then I would be even more anxious and on and on.
> Ivette: Yeah.
> Ivette: Um.
> Myron: Hey Bruce.
## Myron briefly interrupts
> You: Yeah, hey, Myron.
> Myron: I was uh just putting away dinner.
> Myron: Sorry.
> You: No, sorry.
> Myron: You said you said a little thick.
> You: Oh man.
> You: I'm actually getting over this thing, but at times I'm coughing in a way that makes me tear.
> Myron: Oh, holy shit.
> You: Excuse me, god damn.
> Ivette: Sounds painful.
## Continuing the discussion about Lowe's
> You: It is annoying as hell.
> You: But anyway, so yeah, I eventually, you know, you get these, you get write ups and eventually I got enough write ups where they had to say goodbye.
> Ivette: Oh.
> Ivette: Yeah.
> Ivette: I think you were telling I think last time we talked, you were telling me that.
> You: Yeah.
> Ivette: Yeah, you you just yeah, you were just lost your job there.
> You: Yeah.
> Ivette: And uh but I think you yeah, I you you said you got another job but you hadn't I think you got interrupted or something.
> Ivette: You had to do something with the dog and.
> You: Oh my god, your memory.
> You: What the hell?
> Ivette: Yeah, he has much better memory than I do.
> Ivette: My memory is horrible.
> You: That's funny.
## The positive aspects of working at Walgreens
> You: Yeah, so Walgreens is so much more chill.
> Ivette: That's good.
> Ivette: You know, I mean, it still has expectations, but you know, I find it like, oh, if you didn't get X done today, you'll get it done tomorrow.
> Ivette: Mhm.
> You: You know, and I think the management.
> You: You know, I find it like, oh, if you didn't get X done today, you'll get it done tomorrow.
> You: You know, and I think the management has a lot to do with that.
> You: And also just, I guess the demands of the company.
> You: Um, one of the funny funny things that I noticed about Walgreens is there's a ton of times when there's a lot of emptiness on the shelves.
## Comparing Walgreens to Lowe's
> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.
> You: And it's just tells it's just I don't know, I find it odd, especially with Lowe's, they were just so freaking obsessed with, oh, there's a hole, we got to order, we got to fill the hole.
> You: You know.
> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.
> You: So, it's a it's very much a different environment.
## Bruce's commute to Walgreens
> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah, how's your commute?
> Unknown Speaker 15: Good?
> You: Um, no, I don't like it at all.
> You: I mean, my commute to Lowe's was like five minutes.
> You: Um, whereas this is about 30 minutes.
> Unknown Speaker 15: Oh, bummer.
> You: Yeah, it's hard to get hard to get better than five minutes.
> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.
> You: Yeah, that's for sure.
> You: But, you know, it is what it is.
## Difficulty getting to work on time
> You: I'll sacrifice that for but the funny thing is, and I don't I still haven't quite figured out why, but I'm having trouble getting to work on time.
> You: And I think it has to do with I was thinking about it today and it's like this.

> You: Right, right.
> You: I'm doing so much in the morning.
> You: I mean, I usually try to at least even if it's kind of late, I spend like 15 minutes on the sofa vegging out.

> You: She works at the YWCA.

> You: So we've been lucky to coordinate that.
> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.
> You: Um, let's see, she also got her taxes done just the other day.
> Unknown Speaker 15: Oh joy.
## Loss of Ivette's caregiver income
> You: She's trying to, um, so unfortunately, and I think that this is kind of related to a lot of um, let's just say Republican tightening of things.
> You: Um, we had the ability for her to act as Benetton's caregiver.
> Unknown Speaker 15: Right.
> You: Right?
> You: And she would make some money doing that.
> Unknown Speaker 15: Right.
> You: And she had to fill out a bunch of forms and she had to prove that she was doing certain stuff and, you know, somebody would come by once a month and check.
> You: But they changed the rule and now family members can't do that.
> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.
> Unknown Speaker 15: That's a bummer.
> You: So we now lost that income and but my point also is so she's trying to look for somebody, you know, who can, you know, hang out with Benetton for a couple hours and give her a little break.
> You: But it is really unfortunate that, you know, we've lost um, a stream of income from that.
> Unknown Speaker 15: Mhm.
> You: Um, but anyway, so yeah, she's been working and trying to coordinate.
> Unknown Speaker 16: um a stream of income from that.
> Unknown Speaker 16: .
> You: Um but anyway, so yeah, she's been working and trying to coordinate all that.
> Unknown Speaker 16: .
> You: Um uh, excuse me.
## Ivette's lost income and the challenges of government aid for special needs children are discussed.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah, no problem.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah, that's a that's a bummer.
> Unknown Speaker 16: that's that uh that that sort of got that sort of got you off like that.
> You: Yeah, I mean, I get, I get it, you know, I don't I don't really fault them for doing that because it's probably easy to abuse.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.
> You: Yeah.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.
> You: But on the other people who for people who really need it.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.
> You: then Right.
> Unknown Speaker 16: You know, like if if you know, so so as a family member, you're taking care of your, you know, your special needs kid and that means you can't work.
> Unknown Speaker 16: So it's like a Yeah, it's just a double edged sword, right?
> You: Yeah.
> You: Yeah.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.
> Unknown Speaker 16: It's like a double whammy.
> You: I mean Yeah.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.
> You: Yeah, yeah.
> You: I mean we get other kind of small services for him from from the government.
## The complexities of Medicaid and its variations across different states are discussed.
> You: But a lot of the services are completely out of reach because they have this program called the waiver program.
> You: I guess the federal government has, you know, basically, okay, each state is supposed to do X, but the states can choose not to, but then they have to do Y. And so North Carolina is doing Y, but in order to do Y, you have to sign up and because they haven't funded it pretty much at all, they have like a 10 year waiting list.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Oh, no.
> Unknown Speaker 16: I mean they admit it, admit it, they say Medicare, but.
> You: It is through no, it is I think it's weirdly related to Medicare.
> You: Sometimes these things are hard to.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Medicaid.
> You: Yeah.
> You: Um, yes, Medicaid, you're right.
> You: Medicaid.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah, yeah.
> You: Um.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah, you're right.
> Unknown Speaker 16: That's a weird.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Remember that being a weird system and like partially funded by the federal government, but the states have a lot of leeway and influence they put attached to it.
> You: Yeah, right.
> You: Right.
> You: Right.
> You: In fact, something I recently learned and is kind of related to politics.
> You: Um because I read this thing about how, you know, a lot of Republicans were so shocked that um that Medicaid was actually, I'm sorry, Medicare was, I'm sorry, Medicaid was really Medicaid.
> You: In other words, most states call it something else.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Oh, really?
> You: Like, you know, because they can name it something just like because of what you described.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Right, like North Carolina's aid or something like that.
## Discussion about how some states obscure the source of Medicaid benefits to recipients.
> You: Yeah, North Carolina something or other, right?
> Unknown Speaker 16: Right.
> You: So, so they don't even realize that that's what they're receiving.
> You: Oh, and it's Yeah, then when it starts to disappear.
> You: Yeah, it's like, oh shit, what the hell?
> You: I didn't even realize that's what it was.
> You: But anyhow, we're still doing okay.

> You: Yes, Medical.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Cal.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Right.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Cal's similar to that.
> You: Right, right.

> Unknown Speaker 16: Once you write the check, I think that's it'll be it'll be official.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.
> Unknown Speaker 16: So I think he's looking forward to that.

> Unknown Speaker 16: Um but Well, especially for an electrical engineer, yeah.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah, yeah, even around here technology, you know, computer science and electrical engineering, whatever, you know, was pretty easy, but yeah, that's all kind of dried up.
> You: Right.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Bad timing.
> You: Yeah.

> Unknown Speaker 16: Oh, yeah, I'm still yeah, I'm still working at Guidewire, still doing my thing, looking forward to, you know, retirement someday, planning on it in a few years.

> Unknown Speaker 16: I can't help it.
> You: Yeah.

> You: Right, right.

> You: Right.
> You: He was on vacation.
> You: So so I so so my boss had to so we had I had to submit a ticket to get approval for I had to submit a ticket to get approval to get this software and my boss had to submit a ticket to get Oh god.
> You: Oh my god.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Exactly.

> You: Right.
> You: I've done that before in companies.
> You: Especially if it's like, dude, this thing is $30.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.
> Unknown Speaker 16: And with small companies, that's what, you know, that's what you can do and it's, you know, it's really easy and nobody, you know, you know, most people don't take advantage of that, but you get to big companies, man, it is it is hard to, yeah, even like spend a few dollars to make your life easier.
> You: Right.
> You: Well, and now on top of that, you've got IT who needs to have, you know, lockdown control and Yeah, yeah.
> Unknown Speaker 16: Well, and yeah, this one, you know, it may sound surprising, but what I needed a copy of was Excel of all things.
> You: What?
## Bureaucracy and company processes at their respective workplaces are discussed.
> Unknown Speaker 16: I needed.
> You: They don't have Microsoft 365?
> You: I mean, come on.
> Unknown Speaker 16: We we do not because um our our our CEO, who's been he's been about like.
> You: Microsoft 365? I mean, come on.
> You: We we do not because um our our our CEO, who's been he's been about like five years or something. He really likes Google stuff.
> You: Oh.
> You: When when he came in, he's like, get rid of that Microsoft stuff, we're going Google.
> You: And you know, I've got no problem with Google.
> You: Yeah, right.
> You: Like Google but Google Sheets is not Excel. It's just it doesn't have all the stuff.
> You: Yeah, no, it's it's pretty um slim down.
> You: Yeah, exactly.
> You: And of course we our product uses Excel to do some things or basically you you make workbooks and then you you sort of import them in and then that's the that that that makes it do things.
> You: And we do that because our customer base loves Excel.
> You: Yes, right.
> You: And they they live in they live in spreadsheets.
> You: Right, right.
> You: And uh but but you know, just Google doesn't you know, when when it it can read it can read and write Excel spreadsheets, but it just doesn't do a very good job.
> You: Like it like it adds a thousand rows to every every tab when you import.
> You: Uh and so like like I had a file that it that it you know, ballooned in size.
> You: And it got so big that when I actually tried to use it with the program, the program blew up because it ran out of memory.
> You: Oh god.
> You: Like uh and that's that was the final straw.
> You: I'm like, god dang it, I need Excel to do this.
> You: And and of course the irony of the whole thing, apparently I already had it.
> You: I didn't even know.
> You: Oh god.
> You: How do you not know how do you not know that?
> You: I mean, can't you do a quick search?
## Discussion about the CEO's preference for Google Workspace and the limitations of Google Sheets compared to Excel, leading to software issues and the discovery of an existing Excel installation.
> You: No, well, yeah, like you know, you have to kind of log in in you know, to find the application in a certain way.
> You: I guess I just never did it.
> You: Oh.
> You: I'm I'm sure I I'm sure I, you know, either asked for it or there was sort of like a blanket for our team because we use it so much.
> You: Right, but because you never did.
> You: And I didn't even realize it.
> You: Yeah, so I've been struggling with Google Sheets for years.
> You: Oh my god.
> You: Just got online and downloaded Excel.
> You: Oh my god.
> You: So yeah, it was comedy comedy all around.
> Ivette: Were other coworkers using Excel?
> You: Oh yeah, yeah, they do, but I but they also had to get they also had to get uh, you know, uh exemption.
> You: And it's not that it was hard to get.
> You: It was just we just really bad timing.
## Conversation shifts to Ivette's birding activities, including a recent field trip and upcoming volunteer work.
> You: Like I really needed to get this thing done and like, you know, and my boss's boss was on vacation.
> You: And my boss was really great about it.
> You: He was trying to run up all kinds of approvals and I think he finally got the approval probably about eight hours before before his boss actually got back from vacation itself.

> You: And Ivette, are you still birding?
> Ivette: Oh yeah, I've got um helping out on a field trip tomorrow up at Shoreline.

> You: That's that's really cool.
> Ivette: Yeah, it's kind of fun.
> Ivette: And then it's it's sort of surprising too, you know, in a place where there's millions of people.
> Ivette: I see people I know all the time when I'm out on the trail.
> You: Right.
> Ivette: Not when I'm at the mall or at the grocery store.

> Ivette: And that's a little bit of a drive.

> Ivette: So yeah, it's a big chunk of my time.
> Ivette: We've got um the next set of field trips will publish soon.
> Ivette: So all the trip leaders have turned in their stuff to me.
> Ivette: I was proof reading it and then I have a team of people help me publish it.
> Ivette: So we were all working together to get all this stuff published.
> Ivette: So I'm right in the my busiest of weeks for field trip volunteer stuff and um once it's all published on the 28th, then I have a couple little more things to do and then I can kind of take it easy for a couple weeks.
> Ivette: So so truck it along.
> You: Very nice though.
> You: I mean, it's something you really enjoy, so.
> Ivette: Yeah, it keeps me really busy.
> Ivette: I have a variety of tasks to do.
> Ivette: Sometimes I feel like I've been doing it for a while and maybe it's time to mix it up and do something else, but I'm just not sure what else I would do.
## Speculation about alternative hobbies for Ivette, such as snail watching, and a brief mention of moss enthusiasts.
> You: Right.
> Ivette: Um you know, but maybe maybe just keep my eyes open.
> You: Instead of birds, what about like snails?
> Ivette: Snails.
> Ivette: I don't see that, but yeah, I don't know.
> You: Maybe you could make a whole movement about it because we're all going to do snails.
> You: Nobody loves nobody, you know, there's not a big snail, you know, community, right?
> Ivette: Yeah, well, except in France.
> Ivette: The French love the snails.
> Ivette: Yeah, and you don't know, maybe there is and we just don't know.

> Ivette: It's pretty good.
> You: Yeah, it sounds delicious and nice.
> Ivette: Yeah, it's clean.
> You: No TV, right?
> Ivette: Yeah, clean.
