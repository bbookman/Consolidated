I think she might be drinking too much water because her poop looked a little hard.  On a positive note, my boss was really nice and changed my schedule for tomorrow so I could go in at my usual time. \n\n## Atmosphere\nOverall, the atmosphere was a bit chaotic and stressful. There were multiple conversations happening at once, and I was juggling a lot of different tasks. \n\n## Key Takeaways\n* **Investment Strategy:** I need to research investment options that perform well when the stock market declines, such as bonds and treasury bills. I should contact Fidelity for advice.\n* **Peso Exchange Rate:** The current value of the dollar against the peso is high, which could present an opportunity.\n* **Peach's Bathroom Habits:** I need to keep an eye on Peach's water intake and potentially consult with a vet if her bathroom issues persist. \n* **Work Schedule:** My boss was very accommodating and adjusted my schedule for tomorrow. \n",

Sherry acknowledged your efforts and the positive feedback from colleagues like Kathy and Melissa, but emphasized the need for improvement in these areas. She suggested stepping down to a CSA role to reduce stress and allow time to adjust. While you expressed a desire to remain a shift lead, you were open to considering the suggestion.

Sherry seemed to genuinely care about your well-being and wanted to find a solution that worked for everyone. While the feedback was sometimes critical, it was delivered constructively and with a sense of understanding.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n* **Lunch breaks:** Shift leads are encouraged to take lunch breaks, but it's often difficult due to staffing constraints. Clocking out for all breaks is mandatory.\n* **Timecard management:** There have been instances of missed punches and extended breaks. Accuracy is crucial, and any discrepancies must be reported to Sherry.\n* **Performance concerns:**  Sherry addressed performance issues related to cash management, emphasizing the need for improvement. While not explicitly stated, it's implied that continued issues could lead to a written warning.\n* **Stepping down:** Sherry suggested considering a CSA role to reduce stress and allow for a smoother transition. She offered reassurance and support in finding another store if needed.\n* **Positive feedback:** Sherry relayed positive feedback from colleagues, highlighting your work ethic and the respect they have for you.\n* **\"Red box\" warnings:**  These appear on the time clock for late or early punches. While a minor issue, consistent tardiness should be avoided. \n* **Next steps:** You agreed to review and correct your timecard, and you're open to discussing the possibility of stepping down to a CSA role. \n",

Bruce is open to this possibility and will discuss it further with his psychiatrist. \n* **Job Aid and Self-Compassion:** The therapist validated Bruce's efforts to create a job aid, comparing it to pilots using checklists. They also encouraged Bruce to be kinder to himself and avoid negative self-talk. \n* **Divorce and Moving:** Bruce and Yvette are making progress in their separation, with Yvette becoming more open to the idea of a divorce.

She told me about a strange encounter with a guy at the airport in Guadalajara. He kept following her and asking for her number, even after she made it clear she wasn't interested. Thankfully, she's safe and sound now. We also had a sweet moment with Grape, who climbed all the way up the stairs to see me. Yvette even got to say a quick hello. \n\n## Atmosphere:\n\nThe conversation was a mix of lighthearted and concerning. We joked about the reboot and the school delay, but the tone shifted when Yvette shared her experience with the persistent man at the airport.  Despite the unsettling story, we ended on a positive note,  enjoying Grape's antics and her eagerness to see me.\n\n## Key Takeaways:\n\n* There will be a 2-hour school delay on Thursday, February 25th.\n* Yvette had an unnerving experience with a man who wouldn't leave her alone at the airport. \n* Grape is doing well and is becoming quite the little climber! \n",
