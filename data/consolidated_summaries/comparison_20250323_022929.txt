## Section 4: Differences and Consolidation Approach

Bee data uses a structured format with summary, atmosphere, and key takeaways, while Limitless data uses hierarchical content with headings and dialogue transcripts. Bee provides synthesized insights, whereas Limitless offers verbatim conversation details. The consolidation strictly extracts topics from the summary sections of both sources. Timestamps were aligned with a 5-minute tolerance to match related events. Key takeaways from Bee were directly incorporated while only top-level headings were extracted from Limitless. No detailed content or dialogue transcripts were considered in the consolidated view. The consolidated summary focuses exclusively on high-level insights from both summary sources.
