Thankfully, she's safe and sound now. We also had a sweet moment with Grape, who climbed all the way up the stairs to see me. Yvette even got to say a quick hello. \n\n## Atmosphere:\n\nThe conversation was a mix of lighthearted and concerning.

Given we are in North Carolina, I told her how brave she was for wearing it, assuming she was local. Turns out, she was from California! We had a nice chat about how her home state is much more liberal.  She even told me, \"You should see my car,\" which made me laugh.  I also had to help Ivette find a form for Russell - it was on her desk. It was a  \"YWCA Employee Handbook\" acknowledgment form for Russell to sign.

I had a funny interaction with someone who was wearing a pro-LGBTQ+ shirt.  Given we are in North Carolina, I told her how brave she was for wearing it, assuming she was local. Turns out, she was from California! We had a nice chat about how her home state is much more liberal.  She even told me, \"You should see my car,\" which made me laugh.  I also had to help Ivette find a form for Russell - it was on her desk. It was a  \"YWCA Employee Handbook\" acknowledgment form for Russell to sign.

I should contact Fidelity for advice.\n* **Peso Exchange Rate:** The current value of the dollar against the peso is high, which could present an opportunity.\n* **Peach's Bathroom Habits:** I need to keep an eye on Peach's water intake and potentially consult with a vet if her bathroom issues persist. \n* **Work Schedule:** My boss was very accommodating and adjusted my schedule for tomorrow. \n"

He then needed to use the bathroom, so he let someone named Benetton know he was going to move their belongings.  It seems like Benetton may have left their things near the bathroom.\n\nAtmosphere: It seems like a normal day for Bruce. He's keeping track of his health numbers and is also looking after someone named Benetton. \n\nKey Take Aways:\n* Bruce's blood glucose was 125.\n* Bruce's weight was 188 lbs.\n* Bruce had to move Benetton's things to use the bathroom. \n\n\n---\n\n**Bee Summary:**\n## Summary\nBruce was feeling unwell but expressed feelings of happiness to someone they addressed as \"sweetie.\" The other person asked if Bruce was \"looking for a benefit.\"  \n\n## Atmosphere\nThe atmosphere seems potentially tense. Bruce is unwell and the other person's question about \"looking for a benefit\" could be interpreted as skeptical or challenging. \n\n## Key Take Aways\n* Bruce was feeling sick.\n* Despite feeling unwell, Bruce expressed happiness. \n* Bruce called someone \"sweetie.\"\n* The other person questioned if Bruce had ulterior motives. \n\n\n---\n\n**Bee Summary:**\n## Summary\nToday was a mixed bag. I had a frustrating moment with my dog, Peach, who wouldn't stop bugging me to go out even though I had just taken her. I think she might be drinking too much water because her poop looked a little hard.  On a positive note, my boss was really nice and changed my schedule for tomorrow so I could go in at my usual time. \n\n## Atmosphere\nOverall, the atmosphere was a bit chaotic and stressful. There were multiple conversations happening at once, and I was juggling a lot of different tasks. \n\n## Key Takeaways\n* **Investment Strategy:** I need to research investment options that perform well when the stock market declines, such as bonds and treasury bills. I should contact Fidelity for advice.\n* **Peso Exchange Rate:** The current value of the dollar against the peso is high, which could present an opportunity.\n* **Peach's Bathroom Habits:** I need to keep an eye on Peach's water intake and potentially consult with a vet if her bathroom issues persist. \n* **Work Schedule:** My boss was very accommodating and adjusted my schedule for tomorrow.

Discussing double bagging groceries.\n> You: Stop it.\n> You: Just out of curiosity, you double bagged that.\n> Ivette: Yeah, right.\n> You: Oh, I didn't even notice.\n> You: Thank you.\n> Ivette: That's why, yeah, it didn't come.\n> Ivette: Like certain bags, like she got the nuts and stuff, it just I saw there was a rip in it.\n> You: Yep.\n> You: I thought it was something more specific.\n## Ivette demonstrates how to assemble a floating frame\n> You: All right, so did you get much further up?\n> Ivette: I guess the other one.\n> Ivette: I was going to show you.\n> Ivette: It's it's not that hard to fly.\n> Ivette: It's like there's I'll let you do the last one, but I knew there's another one, so I was like, I'll just it up.\n> Ivette: Um, so on this up here.\n> Ivette: Okay.\n> Ivette: Put it to the side.\n> Ivette: Not this part.\n> Ivette: You do.\n> Ivette: Take this out.\n> Ivette: Throw this away for me?\n> You: Oh, these are the backing, right?\n> You: If they wanted to back.\n> Ivette: Yeah.\n> Ivette: So.\n> Ivette: I can throw that in the trash.\n> Ivette: That's fine.\n> Ivette: I just like wipe down here with the glass to make sure nothing's on there, especially if there was a bag, this is like really important.\n> Ivette: But since there isn't a bag, they can wipe it down if they need, you know, like if it gets dustier or dirty.\n> You: Right.\n> Ivette: But when there's a bag there, if there's something trapped in it, it's trapped.\n> Ivette: So, then you get um oh, taking the back off there.\n> Ivette: Second one's usually always easier, but put your glove back on, you don't want to touch it.\n> Ivette: I don't know why I did the other one back.\n> Ivette: Okay, I like doing it here because usually they grab everything, right?\n> Ivette: So then you just take the plastic part.\n> Ivette: Should look like this.\n> You: Got it, floating frame.\n> Ivette: This is the side that matters about being clean too, because this is the side that goes uh against the glass.\n> You: Right.\n> Ivette: So, I'm just trying to get this on the side here.\n> Ivette: Sorry.\n> You: I hope it's not busy tonight.\n> You: I still have a whole bunch of uh mylars to put up.\n> Ivette: That is fine.\n> Ivette: I'm not I'm not worried about that.\n> Ivette: We can hang out.\n> Ivette: So, once this down, like I said, so then you're going to so for like with this, you can't close all four.\n> Ivette: Um but still like even it doesn't fit, but you have to do it this way.\n> Ivette: So, welcome in.\n> Ivette: So, take this side and um just pop it in like this way, make sure it's not too far on this side, just make sure it's like in the middle.\n> Ivette: Pops right in.\n> Ivette: Then this side.\n> You: Okay, I never want to do this.\n> Ivette: It's really not hard.\n> You: I know, I'm just joking.\n> Ivette: I know.\n> Ivette: Yeah, it seems more like but it's really especially if it was busy, I don't know, I get nervous.\n> Ivette: Yeah, during Christmas time it's annoying, but it's fine.\n> Ivette: When you do this side.\n> Ivette: And you notice how they move, but as long as it's in place, it's fine.\n> Ivette: The last step.\n> Ivette: Corner.\n> Ivette: Yep.\n> Ivette: And this one has a extra thing of corners.\n> Ivette: Unlike the canvases.\n> Ivette: You put these in first.\n> Ivette: So, yeah, I know.\n> Ivette: Here.\n> Ivette: We got really just put it like this.\n> You: This?\n> Ivette: Yeah, just put it like this.\n> Ivette: Like here, put it up.\n> Ivette: Gently.\n> Ivette: Put long ways on it.\n> You: Yeah.\n> You: I I'll just put it up here.\n> Ivette: So, this piece, these go in the corner.\n> Ivette: Just kidding.\n> Ivette: Go this way, sorry, that was my fault.\n> Ivette: And they should snap right in the corner.\n> You: Oh, I see the difference between the two.\n> You: And then you know the side because it just goes so like these goes against the corner.\n> Ivette: Fits right in.\n> Ivette: And then these are just like the other ones.\n> Ivette: Okay.\n## Ivette and Bruce finish assembling the first floating frame.\n> Ariel: I see you to see which way it goes this way this part.\n> You: Oh.\n> Ariel: Yeah.\n> Ariel: Let's put it in this here.\n> You: Looks amazing.\n> Ariel: Floating frame done.\n> Ariel: You're time.\n## Ivette selects the photos for the next floating frame and clarifies their dimensions.\n> Ariel: I'm gonna.\n> Ariel: There you go.\n> Ariel: Sir, I just for the first thing is I just put the photos down first.\n> You: Yeah, I was just wondering, are they also the four by.\n> You: So it's not this one, right?\n> Ariel: It's the other one.\n> Ariel: It's that one.\n> Ariel: That's the one I just used.\n> Ariel: Hold it over.\n> Ariel: I hope I did it right.\n> You: They're.\n> You: Oh.\n> Ariel: Okay, we're good.\n> You: Ah, so they're not the four by fours.\n> Ariel: I thought these are four by six.\n> Ariel: This is on top.\n> You: Okay, so that here.\n> Ariel: Basically.\n## Ivette explains the ribbon and paper situation, noting there are two ribbons left and clarifying their usage.\n> Ariel: Yeah.\n> You: Okay.\n> Ariel: That's why I was like, oh, should I worry that I put it in.\n> Ariel: And it's this way, right?\n> Ariel: That one.\n> Ariel: Like it's facing the right way.\n> Ariel: Yep, right.\n> Ariel: Yeah.\n> Ariel: And then.\n> Ariel: There's the gloves.\n> Ariel: What are you doing over here?\n> Ariel: Floating frames.\n> Ariel: We had three within of the four by fours, one and two, two four by six.\n> Ariel: No, but I'll do that later.\n> Ariel: Well, there's also six six that are ordered.\n> Ariel: So I'm gonna get those to help with this.\n> Ariel: That's why I'm gonna have to go upstairs.\n> Ariel: Floating frames upstairs.\n> Ariel: We got to help them upstairs.\n> Ariel: I'm gonna go back to the desk.\n> Ariel: So what I'm gonna do is pout or topics of wall channel of channel to paper.\n> Ariel: Okay, which I'm gonna do that all there.\n> Ariel: I can't.\n> Ariel: I actually can't.\n> Ariel: There's two ribbons left and like six.\n> Ariel: Does change the ribbon?\n> Ariel: Yeah, look.\n> Ariel: But we everybody knows we change the ribbon.\n> Ariel: So then you can leave that until you.\n> You: Yeah.\n> You: Oh.\n> Ariel: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, there's two left.\n> Ariel: Just because it says ribbon, it doesn't mean you can't.\n> Ariel: It's just kind of ribbon.\n> Ariel: I can understand that if you're in here and you're.\n> Ariel: Bruce even knows that.\n> You: I do know that.\n> You: You told me just once and I.\n> Ariel: Yeah.\n> Ariel: You know, you see the a million papers everywhere that say change change at the same time.\n> Ariel: So when I showed up and I do, I said this will make me not like you as a person.\n> You: Okay, so leave those the way they are.\n> Ariel: Yeah, just.\n## Ivette teaches Bruce how to apply the protective film to the floating frames, offering tips and assistance.\n> You: Okay.\n> Ariel: So then that's when you take the blue thing off the one side with the tape.\n> Ariel: You know how to do floating frames?\n> Ariel: I don't know.\n> Ariel: That easy.\n> Ariel: Just do it slow.\n> You: Oh, look at it.\n> You: Oh, is that the wrong side?\n> Ariel: No, it's fine.\n> You: I was just wondering how easy it was.\n> Ariel: And then grab it with the hand that doesn't have the like grab the blue stuff with your hand and then hold that down with the glove.\n> Ariel: Yeah, and then pull it off.\n> Ariel: Cuz some of it is easy, sometimes it's not.\n> Ariel: I know it's tape, which I'll I find if you go from the sides.\n> You: Yeah.\n> Ariel: It's a little like sometimes it's easier to pull it off.\n> Ariel: Yep.\n> Ariel: I'll just do this for you then.\n> You: Yeah, sure.\n> You: Thank you.\n> Ariel: You should just piss me off, so I'm sure it'll probably piss you off too.\n> You: And this will make you very satisfied.\n> Ariel: Oh, no.\n> Ariel: Okay, my fault.\n> Ariel: So it's me so sad now.\n> You: Yes.\n> You: Oh, it's 5:20.\n\n---\n\n**Limitless Recording: Ivette and I

purchasing pineapples, using a self-checkout kiosk, and handling cash tips\n## Applying a screen protector\n> You: not to.\n> Ariel: Why do they touch it?\n> Ariel: That's why I just use my.\n> You: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n> Ariel: Seriously, that's the hardest part.\n> Ariel: Like this.\n> Ariel: Start with that.\n> Ariel: Cool.\n> Ariel: Make sure.\n> Ariel: Here, if you got to touch it, try to put gloves on.\n> You: Oh, I was just going to do this.\n> Ariel: Okay.\n> Ariel: And then.\n> You: Oh.\n> Ariel: No, you're I'm just trying to get.\n> Ariel: Oops.\n> Ariel: All right, and then flip it over.\n> Ariel: So I could.\n> Ariel: I got you.\n> You: Oh, don't want to get any dust on it, right?\n## Pineapple purchase\n> Ariel: Yeah, this I think just the the fingerprint part and the getting the blue thing off it is probably going to be the most tedious and annoying part of this whole thing.\n> Ariel: Sorry.\n> You: This the same as the other one?\n> Ariel: Yeah.\n> You: Oh.\n> Ariel: Here, uh move your hand for me.\n> Ariel: Sorry, it's like right there.\n> Ariel: Is that on the the other side?\n> Ariel: Good.\n> Ariel: Face down.\n> You: Okay.\n> Ariel: Cool.\n> Ariel: Now you do.\n> You: Okay.\n> You: And then, uh, so this side goes in there?\n> Ariel: Yeah, this.\n> You: Okay.\n> You: You got it right.\n> Ariel: You got it right.\n> You: Yep.\n> You: Oh.\n> Ariel: Uh,

Eve Meyer.\n> Ivette: Hello.\n> You: Hi.\n> You: I was almost worried.\n> You: I was almost thinking, oh no, I have energy and I'm driving home.\n> Ivette: Yeah, you just like go.\n> Ivette: We just finished up dinner, so we're sitting here.\n> You: How are the.\n> Ivette: Myron's putting away the group, the um, the dinner food before because it's all still sitting out.\n> Ivette: So, how's it going?\n## My recent cold\n> You: Um, yeah, it's going just fine, I guess.\n> You: Um, we're all getting over like the third cold we've had.\n> You: And and.\n> Ivette: Oh no.\n> You: Yeah, it's just been pretty awful.\n> You: And uh.\n> Ivette: Yeah, you're probably exposed a whole bunch of new things with kids being in school and maybe being at a different place.\n> You: Yeah.\n> You: It could be, but I I know it's yeah, that's for sure.\n> You: And the funny thing is is also it's also pollen season.\n> You: I mean it just started.\n> Ivette: Oh.\n> You: So I look I look really forward to finishing this damn cold and then having allergies.\n> Ivette: Yeah, yeah.\n> Ivette: It's always going to be something.\n## How long I've been at Walgreens\n> You: Oh my god.\n> You: Um.\n> You: So it's good.\n> Ivette: Yeah, go ahead.\n> Ivette: Yeah, go ahead.\n> Ivette: Uh, I was just going to ask you how long you've been at Walgreens now.\n> You: Uh, maybe been about a month and a half.\n> Ivette: Okay, so it's not that long.\n> You: Let's see.\n> You: It's it's March.\n> You: So no, more like um two two and a half months.\n> You: Yeah, I left Lowe's at in January.\n> Ivette: Yeah, I remember when we talked there were issues, but I couldn't quite remember if you had quit or you were you were still there, but things weren't going well.\n> You: Yeah.\n> You: Yeah, you know, I so it's partly mental illness.\n## My mental health struggles at Lowe's\n> Ivette: Um.\n> You: Yeah.\n> You: I uh and it makes no sense if you don't understand mental illness.\n> You: Um but um so I would make some small mistakes.\n> You: And um things like, oh, I forgot to put, you know, the top of the paint can on uh securely.\n> You: And oh, the customer spilled it in their car.\n> You: So, you know, obviously that that's a big deal.\n> You: And the thing was for me, what happened was I sort of did get anxious about that kind of thing.\n> Ivette: Yeah.\n> You: And of course, that made it worse.\n> Ivette: Yeah.\n> You: So it was sort of just the spiral of, you know, oh, if I made the next mistake, you know, then I would be even more anxious and on and on.\n> Ivette: Yeah.\n> Ivette: Um.\n> Myron: Hey Bruce.\n## Myron briefly interrupts\n> You: Yeah, hey, Myron.\n> Myron: I was uh just putting away dinner.\n> Myron: Sorry.\n> You: No, sorry.\n> Myron: You said you said a little thick.\n> You: Oh man.\n> You: I'm actually getting over this thing, but at times I'm coughing in a way that makes me tear.\n> Myron: Oh, holy shit.\n> You: Excuse me, god damn.\n> Ivette: Sounds painful.\n## Continuing the discussion about Lowe's\n> You: It is annoying as hell.\n> You: But anyway, so yeah, I eventually, you know, you get these, you get write ups and eventually I got enough write ups where they had to say goodbye.\n> Ivette: Oh.\n> Ivette: Yeah.\n> Ivette: I think you were telling I think last time we talked, you were telling me that.\n> You: Yeah.\n> Ivette: Yeah, you you just yeah, you were just lost your job there.\n> You: Yeah.\n> Ivette: And uh but I think you yeah, I you you said you got another job but you hadn't I think you got interrupted or something.\n> Ivette: You had to do something with the dog and.\n> You: Oh my god, your memory.\n> You: What the hell?\n> Ivette: Yeah, he has much better memory than I do.\n> Ivette: My memory is horrible.\n> You: That's funny.\n## The positive aspects of working at Walgreens\n> You: Yeah, so Walgreens is so much more chill.\n> Ivette: That's good.\n> Ivette: You know, I mean, it still has expectations, but you know, I find it like, oh, if you didn't get X done today, you'll get it done tomorrow.\n> Ivette: Mhm.\n> You: You know, and I think the management.\n> You: You know, I find it like, oh, if you didn't get X done today, you'll get it done tomorrow.\n> You: You know, and I think the management has a lot to do with that.\n> You: And also just, I guess the demands of the company.\n> You: Um, one of the funny funny things that I noticed about Walgreens is there's a ton of times when there's a lot of emptiness on the shelves.\n## Comparing Walgreens to Lowe's\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> You: And it's just tells it's just I don't know, I find it odd, especially with Lowe's, they were just so freaking obsessed with, oh, there's a hole, we got to order, we got to fill the hole.\n> You: You know.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> You: So, it's a it's very much a different environment.\n## Bruce's commute to Walgreens\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah, how's your commute?\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Good?\n> You: Um, no, I don't like it at all.\n> You: I mean, my commute to Lowe's was like five minutes.\n> You: Um, whereas this is about 30 minutes.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Oh, bummer.\n> You: Yeah, it's hard to get hard to get better than five minutes.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> You: Yeah, that's for sure.\n> You: But, you know, it is what it is.\n## Difficulty getting to work on time\n> You: I'll sacrifice that for but the funny thing is, and I don't I still haven't quite figured out why, but I'm having trouble getting to work on time.\n> You: And I think it has to do with I was thinking about it today and it's like this.\n> You: Okay, I wake up and one of the things that I'm doing now is I'm taking Benetton to school.\n> You: So okay, I take him to school, I come home.\n> You: Now it's about 9:00.\n> You: Okay, 9:00, maybe I'm making breakfast, taking the dogs, doing the dishes.\n> You: So now it's like 10, 10:30, you know, and it's just like I get so and then I have to work at 1:00, right?\n> You: So it's like all this like little things and then all of a sudden it's like, shit, I got to go to work.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Well, yeah, you'll probably get used to that, right?\n## Past work schedules\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Have you ever had a job that's later that starts later in the day or they're all starting, you know, sort of morning?\n> You: Yeah, I mean, I mean, other than Lowe's, which most of the time, I'm trying to remember, you know, I occasionally would start in the afternoon, but yeah, it was most mornings.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: I think that would be kind of destructive to me too.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: I'm not, you know, I'm used to getting up and then I, you know, eat breakfast.\n> You: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: You take a shower, you go.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: I don't yeah, I don't do stuff before work.\n> You: Right, right.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: I can see how that could throw you off.\n> You: Yeah.\n## Morning routine and bowel movements\n> Unknown Speaker 15: You're you're doing stuff and you're like, oh, well, I'm done with work.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: No, no, I haven't even started yet.\n> You: Right.\n> You: And it's and And I have to have a bowel movement and that's like another 15, 20, right?\n> Unknown Speaker 15: And then you don't really get a chance to relax.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Like if it was a morning job, you could come home maybe in the evening and say, okay, now I can kind of chill out or whatever, but you don't really get that opportunity.\n> You: Right, right.\n> You: I'm doing so much in the morning.\n> You: I mean, I usually try to at least even if it's kind of late, I spend like 15 minutes on the sofa vegging out.\n> You: Um, just to kind of feel like I've transitioned to home.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> You: But yeah, um, so yeah, we're getting over cold.\n## Family updates\n> You: Kids are doing pretty well at school.\n> You: Russell getting closer and closer to graduating.\n> You: He graduates either in December or January.\n> You: Um.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Great.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Very cool.\n> You: Yeah, so and he's got a sorry, go ahead.\n## Russell's graduation and college plans\n> Unknown Speaker 15: I was just going to ask what he's going to do after that or.\n> You: Um, so um, he's he's going to community college.\n> You: There's a community college here, uh, to start.\n> You: That's what his plan is.\n> You: Um, in fact, my mom and dad are coming out in about two or three weeks.\n> You: I haven't been.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Oh, that's great.\n> You: And, um, he's going to give them a tour.\n> You: He arranged for a tour for them.\n> You: Um, also because they set up a 529 for him.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Mhm.\n> You: So they want to kind of, you know, see what their money's going to do.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Good good good for them.\n## Bruce's parents' visit\n> Unknown Speaker 15: That's good.\n> You: And also just, you know, feel like they're plugged into what the grandkid is doing.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah, I think that's that's nice.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Nice to hear your parents are doing well enough that they can get on the plane.\n> You: You know, yeah, I'm I'm really surprised about it myself.\n> You: I think, um, I'm I just I suspect my mom really misses us and kind of worries.\n> You: And, you know, I mean, like hearing how many times I've lost my job in the last two years.\n> You: You know, she wants to see that her her her boy is okay, you know.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.\n> You: So, I I I suspect.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Mother's instincts.\n> You: Yeah, I suspect that's a lot of it.\n> You: Otherwise, there's no I'm shocked that they're getting on an airplane.\n## Ivette's work and childcare\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Because that's not yeah, last time they came out, you said it was pretty it was pretty tough mobility wise.\n> You: Yeah, I'm I'm like I thought that that was the very last time they'd ever be on a plane.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> You: So, I'm thankful and you know, I'm sure they're looking forward to it.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Mhm.\n> You: Um, so yeah, we'll have them coming out.\n> You: Um, we just had a visit from a guy named Patrick.\n> You: He had he's a friend of Ivette's."

And so North Carolina is doing Y, but in order to do Y, you have to sign up and because they haven't funded it pretty much at all, they have like a 10 year waiting list.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Oh, no.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: I mean they admit it, admit it, they say Medicare, but.\n> You: It is through no, it is I think it's weirdly related to Medicare.\n> You: Sometimes these things are hard to.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Medicaid.\n> You: Yeah.\n> You: Um, yes, Medicaid, you're right.\n> You: Medicaid.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah, yeah.\n> You: Um.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah, you're right.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: That's a weird.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Remember that being a weird system and like partially funded by the federal government, but the states have a lot of leeway and influence they put attached to it.\n> You: Yeah, right.\n> You: Right.\n> You: Right.\n> You: In fact, something I recently learned and is kind of related to politics.\n> You: Um because I read this thing about how, you know, a lot of Republicans were so shocked that um that Medicaid was actually, I'm sorry, Medicare was, I'm sorry, Medicaid was really Medicaid.\n> You: In other words, most states call it something else.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Oh, really?\n> You: Like, you know, because they can name it something just like because of what you described.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Right, like North Carolina's aid or something like that.\n## Discussion about how some states obscure the source of Medicaid benefits to recipients.\n> You: Yeah, North Carolina something or other, right?\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Right.\n> You: So, so they don't even realize that that's what they're receiving.\n> You: Oh, and it's Yeah, then when it starts to disappear.\n> You: Yeah, it's like, oh shit, what the hell?\n> You: I didn't even realize that's what it was.\n> You: But anyhow, we're still doing okay.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: I think here in California's Medical.\n> You: Yes, Medical.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Cal.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Right.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Cal's similar to that.\n> You: Right, right.\n> You: And it's easier to understand what that is.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.\n> You: Um and how about your boys?\n## Updates and future plans regarding each other's children are shared.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: No, they're doing good.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah, Ben's Ben's still working.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: He's uh he's applied to uh uh immersion program in Japan.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: So he's waiting for that.\n>

Speaker 16: We haven't written the check.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Once you write the check, I think that's it'll be it'll be official.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: So I think he's looking forward to that.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Um and that won't be until uh spring uh fall, I think.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: So he's got, you know, he's got a a ways to go, but he's working still, working working remote.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Um and uh and Sam's, you know, still doing still doing school.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: He's got another got a year or so to go, I think.\n> Unknown

for an electrical engineer, yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah, yeah, even around here technology, you know, computer science and electrical engineering, whatever, you know, was pretty easy, but yeah, that's all kind of dried up.\n> You: Right.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Bad timing.\n> You: Yeah.\n> You: Yeah.\n> You: Uh and you too?\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Oh, yeah, I'm still yeah, I'm still working at

much everything.\n> You: Right, right.\n> You: Now it's now it's a very big company.\n> You: We're just a small we're just a small piece of it, but uh um but yeah, you know, it's so much more

It's just it doesn't have all the stuff.\n> You: Yeah, no, it's it's pretty um slim down.\n> You: Yeah, exactly.\n> You: And of course we our product uses Excel to do some things or basically you you make workbooks and then you you sort of import them in and then that's the that that that makes it do things.\n> You: And we do that because our customer base loves Excel.\n> You: Yes, right.\n> You: And they they live in they live in spreadsheets.\n> You: Right, right.\n> You: And uh but but you know, just Google doesn't you know, when when it it can read it can read and write Excel spreadsheets, but it just doesn't do a very good job.\n> You: Like it like it adds a thousand rows to every every tab when you import.\n> You: Uh and so like like I had a file that it that it you know, ballooned in size.\n> You: And it got so big that when I actually tried to use it with the program, the program blew up because it ran out of memory.\n> You: Oh god.\n> You: Like uh and that's that was the final straw.\n> You: I'm like, god dang it, I need Excel to do this.\n> You: And and of course the irony of the whole thing, apparently I already had it.\n> You: I didn't even know.\n> You: Oh god.\n> You: How do you not know how do you not know that?\n> You: I mean, can't you do a quick search?\n## Discussion about the CEO's preference for Google Workspace and the limitations of Google Sheets compared to Excel, leading to software issues and the discovery of an existing Excel installation.\n> You: No, well, yeah, like you know, you have to kind of log in in you know, to find the application in a certain way.\n> You: I guess I just never did it.\n> You: Oh.\n> You: I'm I'm sure I I'm sure I, you know, either asked for it or there was sort of like a blanket for our team because we use it so much.\n> You: Right, but because you never did.\n> You: And I didn't even realize it.\n> You: Yeah, so I've been struggling with Google Sheets for years.\n> You: Oh my god.\n> You: Just got online and downloaded Excel.\n> You: Oh my god.\n> You: So yeah, it was comedy comedy all around.\n> Ivette: Were other coworkers using Excel?\n> You: Oh yeah, yeah, they do, but I but they also had to get they also had to get uh, you know, uh exemption.\n> You: And it's not that it was hard to get.\n> You: It was just we just really bad timing.\n## Conversation shifts to Ivette's birding activities, including a recent field trip and upcoming volunteer work.\n> You: Like I really needed to get this thing done and like, you know, and my boss's boss was on vacation.\n> You: And my boss was really great about it.\n> You: He was trying to run up all kinds of approvals and I think he finally got the approval probably about eight hours before before his boss actually got back from vacation itself.\n> You: It was all all pointless anyway because I had it too, so.\n> You: And Ivette, are you still birding?\n> Ivette: Oh yeah, I've got um helping out on a field trip tomorrow up at Shoreline.\n> Ivette: And then uh Myron and Ben came with me today to go see a rare bird up at Joseph D.

Ivette calls me while driving home and we discuss my new job at Walgreens, my previous job at Lowe's, and my recent cold\n## Catching up and discussing dinner\n> Ivette: Call Eve Meyer.\n> Unknown Speaker 3: Which phone for Eve Meyer?\n> Unknown Speaker 3: Home?\n> Unknown Speaker 3: Calling Eve Meyer.\n> Unknown Speaker 3: Mobile.\n> You: Hi, you've reached Eve Meyer.\n> Ivette: Hello.\n> You: Hi.\n> You: I was almost worried.\n> You: I was almost thinking, oh no, I have energy and I'm driving home.\n> Ivette: Yeah, you just like go.\n> Ivette: We just finished up dinner, so we're sitting here.\n> You: How are the.\n> Ivette: Myron's putting away the group, the um, the dinner food before because it's all still sitting out.\n> Ivette: So, how's it going?\n## My recent cold\n> You: Um, yeah, it's going just fine, I guess.\n> You: Um, we're all getting over like the third cold we've had.\n> You: And and.\n> Ivette: Oh no.\n> You: Yeah, it's just been pretty awful.\n> You: And uh.\n> Ivette: Yeah, you're probably exposed a whole bunch of new things with kids being in school and maybe being at a different place.\n> You: Yeah.\n> You: It could be, but I I know it's yeah, that's for sure.\n> You: And the funny thing is is also it's also pollen season.\n> You: I mean it just started.\n> Ivette: Oh.\n> You: So I look I look really forward to finishing this damn cold and then having allergies.\n> Ivette: Yeah, yeah.\n> Ivette: It's always going to be something.\n## How long I've been at Walgreens\n> You: Oh my god.\n> You: Um.\n> You: So it's good.\n> Ivette: Yeah, go ahead.\n> Ivette: Yeah, go ahead.\n> Ivette: Uh, I was just going to ask you how long you've been at Walgreens now.\n> You: Uh, maybe been about a month and a half.\n> Ivette: Okay, so it's not that long.\n> You: Let's see.\n> You: It's it's March.\n> You: So no, more like um two two and a half months.\n> You: Yeah, I left Lowe's at in January.\n> Ivette: Yeah, I remember when we talked there were issues, but I couldn't quite remember if you had quit or you were you were still there, but things weren't going well.\n> You: Yeah.\n> You: Yeah, you know, I so it's partly mental illness.\n## My mental health struggles at Lowe's\n> Ivette: Um.\n> You: Yeah.\n> You: I uh and it makes no sense if you don't understand mental illness.\n> You: Um but um so I would make some small mistakes.\n> You: And um things like, oh, I forgot to put, you know, the top of the paint can on uh securely.\n> You: And oh, the customer spilled it in their car.\n> You: So, you know, obviously that that's a big deal.\n> You: And the thing was for me, what happened was I sort of did get anxious about that kind of thing.\n> Ivette: Yeah.\n> You: And of course, that made it worse.\n> Ivette: Yeah.\n> You: So it was sort of just the spiral of, you know, oh, if I made the next mistake, you know, then I would be even more anxious and on and on.\n> Ivette: Yeah.\n> Ivette: Um.\n> Myron: Hey Bruce.\n## Myron briefly interrupts\n> You: Yeah, hey, Myron.\n> Myron: I was uh just putting away dinner.\n> Myron: Sorry.\n> You: No, sorry.\n> Myron: You said you said a little thick.\n> You: Oh man.\n> You: I'm actually getting over this thing, but at times I'm coughing in a way that makes me tear.\n> Myron: Oh, holy shit.\n> You: Excuse me, god damn.\n> Ivette: Sounds painful.\n## Continuing the discussion about Lowe's\n> You: It is annoying as hell.\n> You: But anyway, so yeah, I eventually, you know, you get these, you get write ups and eventually I got enough write ups where they had to say goodbye.\n> Ivette: Oh.\n> Ivette: Yeah.\n> Ivette: I think you were telling I think last time we talked, you were telling me that.\n> You: Yeah.\n> Ivette: Yeah, you you just yeah, you were just lost your job there.\n> You: Yeah.\n> Ivette: And uh but I think you yeah, I you you said you got another job but you hadn't I think you got interrupted or something.\n> Ivette: You had to do something with the dog and.\n> You: Oh my god, your memory.\n> You: What the hell?\n> Ivette: Yeah, he has much better memory than I do.\n> Ivette: My memory is horrible.\n> You: That's funny.\n## The positive aspects of working at Walgreens\n> You: Yeah, so Walgreens is so much more chill.\n> Ivette: That's good.\n> Ivette: You know, I mean, it still has expectations, but you know, I find it like, oh, if you didn't get X done today, you'll get it done tomorrow.\n> Ivette: Mhm.\n> You: You know, and I think the management.\n> You: You know, I find it like, oh, if you didn't get X done today, you'll get it done tomorrow.\n> You: You know, and I think the management has a lot to do with that.\n> You: And also just, I guess the demands of the company.\n> You: Um, one of the funny funny things that I noticed about Walgreens is there's a ton of times when there's a lot of emptiness on the shelves.\n## Comparing Walgreens to Lowe's\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> You: And it's just tells it's just I don't know, I find it odd, especially with Lowe's, they were just so freaking obsessed with, oh, there's a hole, we got to order, we got to fill the hole.\n> You: You know.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> You: So, it's a it's very much a different environment.\n## Bruce's commute to Walgreens\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah, how's your commute?\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Good?\n> You: Um, no, I don't like it at all.\n> You: I mean, my commute to Lowe's was like five minutes.\n> You: Um, whereas this is about 30 minutes.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Oh, bummer.\n> You: Yeah, it's hard to get hard to get better than five minutes.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> You: Yeah, that's for sure.\n> You: But, you know, it is what it is.\n## Difficulty getting to work on time\n> You: I'll sacrifice that for but the funny thing is, and I don't I still haven't quite figured out why, but I'm having trouble getting to work on time.\n> You: And I think it has to do with I was thinking about it today and it's like this.\n> You: Okay, I wake up and one of the things that I'm doing now is I'm taking Benetton to school.\n> You: So okay, I take him to school, I come home.\n> You: Now it's about 9:00.\n> You: Okay, 9:00, maybe I'm making breakfast, taking the dogs, doing the dishes.\n> You: So now it's like 10, 10:30, you know, and it's just like I get so and then I have to work at 1:00, right?\n> You: So it's like all this like little things and then all of a sudden it's like, shit, I got to go to work.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Well, yeah, you'll probably get used to that, right?\n## Past work schedules\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Have you ever had a job that's later that starts later in the day or they're all starting, you know, sort of morning?\n> You: Yeah, I mean, I mean, other than Lowe's, which most of the time, I'm trying to remember, you know, I occasionally would start in the afternoon, but yeah, it was most mornings.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: I think that would be kind of destructive to me too.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: I'm not, you know, I'm used to getting up and then I, you know, eat breakfast.\n> You: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: You take a shower, you go.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: I don't yeah, I don't do stuff before work.\n> You: Right, right.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: I can see how that could throw you off.\n> You: Yeah.\n## Morning routine and bowel movements\n> Unknown Speaker 15: You're you're doing stuff and you're like, oh, well, I'm done with work.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: No, no, I haven't even started yet.\n> You: Right.\n> You: And it's and And I have to have a bowel movement and that's like another 15, 20, right?\n> Unknown Speaker 15: And then you don't really get a chance to relax.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Like if it was a morning job, you could come home maybe in the evening and say, okay, now I can kind of chill out or whatever, but you don't really get that opportunity.\n> You: Right, right.\n> You: I'm doing so much in the morning.\n> You: I mean, I usually try to at least even if it's kind of late, I spend like 15 minutes on the sofa vegging out.\n> You: Um, just to kind of feel like I've transitioned to home.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> You: But yeah, um, so yeah, we're getting over cold.\n## Family updates\n> You: Kids are doing pretty well at school.\n> You: Russell getting closer and closer to graduating.\n> You: He graduates either in December or January.\n> You: Um.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Great.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Very cool.\n> You: Yeah, so and he's got a sorry, go ahead.\n## Russell's graduation and college plans\n> Unknown Speaker 15: I was just going to ask what he's going to do after that or.\n> You: Um, so um, he's he's going to community college.\n> You: There's a community college here, uh, to start.\n> You: That's what his plan is.\n> You: Um, in fact, my mom and dad are coming out in about two or three weeks.\n> You: I haven't been.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Oh, that's great.\n> You: And, um, he's going to give them a tour.\n> You: He arranged for a tour for them.\n> You: Um, also because they set up a 529 for him.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Mhm.\n> You: So they want to kind of, you know, see what their money's going to do.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Good good good for them.\n## Bruce's parents' visit\n> Unknown Speaker 15: That's good.\n> You: And also just, you know, feel like they're plugged into what the grandkid is doing.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah, I think that's that's nice.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Nice to hear your parents are doing well enough that they can get on the plane.\n> You: You know, yeah, I'm I'm really surprised about it myself.\n> You: I think, um, I'm I just I suspect my mom really misses us and kind of worries.\n> You: And, you know, I mean, like hearing how many times I've lost my job in the last two years.\n> You: You know, she wants to see that her her her boy is okay, you know.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.\n> You: So, I I I suspect.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Mother's instincts.\n> You: Yeah, I suspect that's a lot of it.\n> You: Otherwise, there's no I'm shocked that they're getting on an airplane.\n## Ivette's work and childcare\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Because that's not yeah, last time they came out, you said it was pretty it was pretty tough mobility wise.\n> You: Yeah, I'm I'm like I thought that that was the very last time they'd ever be on a plane.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> You: So, I'm thankful and you know, I'm sure they're looking forward to it.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Mhm.\n> You: Um, so yeah, we'll have them coming out.\n> You: Um, we just had a visit from a guy named Patrick.\n> You: He had he's a friend of Ivette's.Discussing recent visitors and Ivette's work\n\n# Discussing recent visitors and Ivette's work\n## Patrick's visit\n> You: He had come out last year as as well.\n> You: And he's a really nice guy and he's really great with the kids too.\n> You: Um.\n> You: So that was that was that was pretty nice.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Will your parents stay with you when they come?\n## Bruce's parents' accommodations\n> You: Oh no, there's yeah, no, there's no way.\n> You: I mean, even if they could in some fashion, it would just be so uncomfortable for them.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> You: Don't mind if I die.\n## Brief health update\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Oh, you got to hurt your ribs.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: That feels like a lung is coming up.\n> You: Oh God.\n## Ivette's work at the YWCA\n> You: But, uh, yeah, so what else can I tell you?\n> Unknown Speaker 15: How's Ivette doing too?\n> You: Um, so she's been working.\n> You: She works at the YWCA.\n> You: I think you guys know that.\n> You: Um, and they're starting to ask her to work more.\n> You: So we've been lucky to coordinate that.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> You: Um, let's see, she also got her taxes done just the other day.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Oh joy.\n## Loss of Ivette's caregiver income\n> You: She's trying to, um, so unfortunately, and I think that this is kind of related to a lot of um, let's just say Republican tightening of things.\n> You: Um, we had the ability for her to act as Benetton's caregiver.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Right.\n> You: Right?\n> You: And she would make some money doing that.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Right.\n> You: And she had to fill out a bunch of forms and she had to prove that she was doing certain stuff and, you know, somebody would come by once a month and check.\n> You: But they changed the rule and now family members can't do that.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: That's a bummer.\n> You: So we now lost that income and but my point also is so she's trying to look for somebody, you know, who can, you know, hang out with Benetton for a couple hours and give her a little break.\n> You: But it is really unfortunate that, you know, we've lost um, a stream of income from that.\n> Unknown Speaker 15: Mhm.\n> You: Um, but anyway, so yeah, she's been working and trying to coordinate.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: um a stream of income from that.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: .\n> You: Um but anyway, so yeah, she's been working and trying to coordinate all that.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: .\n> You: Um uh, excuse me.\n## Ivette's lost income and the challenges of government aid for special needs children are discussed.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah, no problem.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah, that's a that's a bummer.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: that's that uh that that sort of got that sort of got you off like that.\n> You: Yeah, I mean, I get, I get it, you know, I don't I don't really fault them for doing that because it's probably easy to abuse.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.\n> You: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.\n> You: But on the other people who for people who really need it.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.\n> You: then Right.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: You know, like if if you know, so so as a family member, you're taking care of your, you know, your special needs kid and that means you can't work.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: So it's like a Yeah, it's just a double edged sword, right?\n> You: Yeah.\n> You: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: It's like a double whammy.\n> You: I mean Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.\n> You: Yeah, yeah.\n> You: I mean we get other kind of small services for him from from the government.\n## The complexities of Medicaid and its variations across different states are discussed.\n> You: But a lot of the services are completely out of reach because they have this program called the waiver program.\n> You: I guess the federal government has, you know, basically, okay, each state is supposed to do X, but the states can choose not to, but then they have to do Y. And so North Carolina is doing Y, but in order to do Y, you have to sign up and because they haven't funded it pretty much at all, they have like a 10 year waiting list.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Oh, no.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: I mean they admit it, admit it, they say Medicare, but.\n> You: It is through no, it is I think it's weirdly related to Medicare.\n> You: Sometimes these things are hard to.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Medicaid.\n> You: Yeah.\n> You: Um, yes, Medicaid, you're right.\n> You: Medicaid.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah, yeah.\n> You: Um.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah, you're right.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: That's a weird.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Remember that being a weird system and like partially funded by the federal government, but the states have a lot of leeway and influence they put attached to it.\n> You: Yeah, right.\n> You: Right.\n> You: Right.\n> You: In fact, something I recently learned and is kind of related to politics.\n> You: Um because I read this thing about how, you know, a lot of Republicans were so shocked that um that Medicaid was actually, I'm sorry, Medicare was, I'm sorry, Medicaid was really Medicaid.\n> You: In other words, most states call it something else.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Oh, really?\n> You: Like, you know, because they can name it something just like because of what you described.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Right, like North Carolina's aid or something like that.\n## Discussion about how some states obscure the source of Medicaid benefits to recipients.\n> You: Yeah, North Carolina something or other, right?\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Right.\n> You: So, so they don't even realize that that's what they're receiving.\n> You: Oh, and it's Yeah, then when it starts to disappear.\n> You: Yeah, it's like, oh shit, what the hell?\n> You: I didn't even realize that's what it was.\n> You: But anyhow, we're still doing okay.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: I think here in California's Medical.\n> You: Yes, Medical.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Cal.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Right.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Cal's similar to that.\n> You: Right, right.\n> You: And it's easier to understand what that is.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.\n> You: Um and how about your boys?\n## Updates and future plans regarding each other's children are shared.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: No, they're doing good.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah, Ben's Ben's still working.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: He's uh he's applied to uh uh immersion program in Japan.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: So he's waiting for that.\n> You: Oh, yeah.\n> You: Right.\n> You: Um.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Looking good so far, but that's that's you know, nothing nothing official totally official yet.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: We haven't written the check.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Once you write the check, I think that's it'll be it'll be official.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: So I think he's looking forward to that.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Um and that won't be until uh spring uh fall, I think.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: So he's got, you know, he's got a a ways to go, but he's working still, working working remote.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Um and uh and Sam's, you know, still doing still doing school.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: He's got another got a year or so to go, I think.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Um and Sam's at ASU.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: And he's thinking about uh he's thinking about a master's thing.\n> You: Oh, wow.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: And so so he might be he might even be there longer than that.\n> You: And remind me, was he in mechanical engineering?\n> You: I'm trying to remember.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Elec electrical.\n## The current job market and retirement planning are discussed.\n> You: Oh, electrical engineering.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah, electrical engineering.\n> You: Wow.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah, it's the the job market is not great right now.\n> You: Oh, no.\n> You: My god, the job market is horrific.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah, we were just talking about dinner.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: You know, he's he's Sam's trying to apply for internships right over the summer and it's just like they just don't exist.\n> You: Yeah.\n> You: No.\n> You: It the it's horrific.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Which like, you know what, two years ago was fine, right?\n> Unknown Speaker 16: You know, you you you you know, couldn't you practically tripped over job offers, right?\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Um but Well, especially for an electrical engineer, yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah, yeah, even around here technology, you know, computer science and electrical engineering, whatever, you know, was pretty easy, but yeah, that's all kind of dried up.\n> You: Right.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Bad timing.\n> You: Yeah.\n> You: Yeah.\n> You: Uh and you too?\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Oh, yeah, I'm still yeah, I'm still working at Guidewire, still doing my thing, looking forward to, you know, retirement someday, planning on it in a few years.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: I haven't chosen any date or anything like that, but I'm sort of because I was just telling Eve this morning, I'm like, I'm kind of trying to back back away from, you know, some, you know, some responsibilities and things that I already had.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: He butts his nose into way too many things.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: I can't help it.\n> You: Yeah.\n> You: Then that's a really that's a very smart thing.\n> You: That's Yeah, it's just it's hard though to, you know, after, you know, having been there for almost 20 years, right?\n> You: And, you know, watching it grow from, you know, something very small where, you know, everybody did pretty much everything.\n> You: Right, right.\n> You: Now it's now it's a very big company.\n> You: We're just a small we're just a small piece of it, but uh um but yeah, you know, it's so much more bureaucracy and things.\n> You: So I was I was joking that uh I had I had to get a a license to use a piece of software and it had to be approved by my boss's boss.\n> You: Right.\n> You: He was on vacation.\n> You: So so I so so my boss had to so we had I had to submit a ticket to get approval for I had to submit a ticket to get approval to get this software and my boss had to submit a ticket to get Oh god.\n> You: Oh my god.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Exactly.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah, so like, oh god.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: I said somebody just I I was I was seriously tempted to say, you know, I could just go online and like just buy it.\n> You: Yeah, right.\n> You: Right.\n> You: I've done that before in companies.\n> You: Especially if it's like, dude, this thing is $30.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: And with small companies, that's what, you know, that's what you can do and it's, you know, it's really easy and nobody, you know, you know, most people don't take advantage of that, but you get to big companies, man, it is it is hard to, yeah, even like spend a few dollars to make your life easier.\n> You: Right.\n> You: Well, and now on top of that, you've got IT who needs to have, you know, lockdown control and Yeah, yeah.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: Well, and yeah, this one, you know, it may sound surprising, but what I needed a copy of was Excel of all things.\n> You: What?\n## Bureaucracy and company processes at their respective workplaces are discussed.\n> Unknown Speaker 16: I needed.\n> You: They don't have Microsoft 365?\n> You: I mean,
